	I Created My Own Music Bot for Discord!
  </h2>
  
  <body style="background-color:lightseagreen;">
   <p>
   <br></br>
	Since the popular Discord music bot "Rythm" was shutdown by Youtube, my friends and I in our server had no way 
   for all of us to listen to the same track at the same time. So, I decided to take this as an opportunity learn 
   Javasctipt and build one! You can view the code on Github <a href="https://github.com/JonRhea/Music-Bot-2.0">here!</a><br></br>

   </p> 
   <p>It's called 2.0 because the first one I had was someone else's (it was used with permission!). This 2.0 version is one that I build
    compeletly from scratch. Obviously, I used the Discord.js API to create this bot. <br></br>
   </p>
   <p>
	To play a song, type "/play". The bot accepts search keywords and plays the first result of Youtube based on those serach keywords.
	This does mean you have to be somewhat specific to get the song you want. However, typoes are usually not a big deal
	 due to Youtube's search engine.

	  <br></br>
   </p>
   <p>
   If someone want's to stop listening to a song for any reason, they can use the "/skip" command to stop playing 
   the current song and play the next song if there is a song in the queue. <br></br>
   <img src="https://418y-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/songskip.PNG" width="1000" "alt="Skipping the current song">
   <br></br>
   </p>
   <p>
	Anyone can request a song to play. If a song is already playing and a song is requested, the requested song will be put 
	into a queue. Using "/queue", you can view what song is playing, what songs are in the queue, who requested the song, and
	how long the song is. Also, 10 songs are listed on a page. If you want to view a page that is not the first page, the command 
	allows you to add a number to it to view that page number of the queue.

   </p>
   <p>
  	 If a song is playing that you don't recognize or you want to know how much longer the song has to go, use the "/info" command.
   	This command displays the current song playing and shows a bar which shows how much longer the song has. <br></br>

   </p>
   <p>
   And that's the bot! Considering I had not messed with Javascript for Node.js before, I feel pretty proud of this.
